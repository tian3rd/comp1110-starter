/**
 * This class represents the Vikings - Brainstorm game.
 * <p>
 * The board state is represented by a single string.
 * The first 18 characters represent the placement of the nine tiles in
 * order from left to right and top to bottom.
 * <p>
 * 0   1   2
 * 3   4   5
 * 6   7   8
 * <p>
 * The two tile types are represented by the uppercase characters 'N'
 * and 'O', with the four rotations represented by the digits 0-3.
 * The four boats are represented by an uppercase character which is the
 * first letter of the name of the colour i.e. 'B','G','R','Y'.
 * Edges are represented by a lowercase character 'a'-'x'.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *   a   b   c
 * d 0 e 1 f 2 g
 *   h   i   j
 * k 3 l 4 m 5 n
 *   o   p   q
 * r 6 s 7 t 8 u
 *   v   w   x
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Thus the string 'Bl' represents a blue boat at edge 'l' (in between
 * tiles '3' and '4'.
 * <p>
 * The first objective in the game book is
 * "N0O1N1N0O0O1N0N3N1Rt", "Rv"
 * Where "N0O1N1N0O0O1N0N3N1Rt" represents the initial boardState and "Rv" represents the objective (ie:
 * the red boat get to edge v)
